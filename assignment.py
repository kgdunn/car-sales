Assignment goals:

practice creating custom transformers and estimators
practice performing grid search
build custom pipelines
solidify git knowledge and practice working together effectively
make a first attempt to productionizing ML model

For this lab we will be using car sales dataset from Kaggle. I know - everybody is sick of
predicting car prices by now, but cars happen to have a good mix of numerical and categorical
features and that's just what we need for this exercise.

Remember, the main objective of this assignment is not to train the most accurate model, but to
practice building custom blocks of estimators and transformers.
